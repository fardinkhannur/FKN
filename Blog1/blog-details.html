                    <h2 class="custom-heading">Processor</h2>
                    <p>
                        The processor, often referred to as the "heart" of the computer, is where all the critical tasks are performed. Processors are built with cores and threads, with the number varying depending on the model. For instance, processors may come with configurations like 6 cores and 12 threads, 8 cores and 16 threads, or even up to 32 cores. In 2024, the standard configuration is typically 6 cores and 12 threads due to the increasing complexity of software. To ensure smooth operation, a robust CPU is essential.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are two major players in the processor market: Intel and AMD. Both brands dominate the PC-building industry. While other processors, like Snapdragon or Apple’s M-series chips, exist, they are typically reserved for specific products and are not suitable for custom PC builds. When choosing a processor, it's important to consider the type of work you'll be doing. Different tasks require different CPU performances, such as single-core or multi-core processing. For example, some applications depend heavily on single-core performance, while others require multi-core capabilities.

            <h2 class="custom-heading">Motherboard</h2>
            <p>
              The motherboard is the core component of a PC, connecting and powering every other part, such as the processor, RAM, SSD, and more. A good motherboard ensures that all components receive sufficient power to run smoothly, preventing potential damage from power issues. This is particularly true if the motherboard has a quality VRM (Voltage Regulator Module) section, which ensures stable power delivery to the processor and other components, safeguarding them from overheating or burning out.
            </p>
            <p>
              When building a custom PC, selecting the right motherboard is crucial. There are two main types of motherboards based on the processor they support: one for Intel processors and the other for AMD processors. Intel motherboards use the LGA 1700 socket, specifically designed to be compatible with Intel CPUs. On the other hand, AMD motherboards use AM4 or AM5 sockets, with the latest generation utilizing the AM5 socket.
            </p>

          <div class="portfolio-text">
            <p>
              Motherboards come in various models, distinguished by their chipset, such as A520, B450, B550, B650, X670, and others. These models vary between generations and support different sockets. Additionally, motherboards can differ in the number of RAM slots they offer—some have two, others four, and some even have eight slots, allowing users to easily upgrade their memory.
            </p>
            <p>
              Modern motherboards also support high-speed NVMe M.2 SSDs, with many offering four to five slots for storage expansion, giving users ample room for upgrades. Currently, AMD motherboards are generally more affordable than Intel ones while offering comparable performance. This makes AMD an attractive option for users looking to balance price and performance. However, it's essential to match an AMD motherboard with an AMD processor for compatibility.

                    <h2 class="custom-heading">RAM</h2>
                    <p>
                        When you're upgrading your PC, one of the most important components to consider is the RAM (Random Access Memory). RAM is like the brain's short-term memory in your computer, helping it quickly access the data it needs to run applications smoothly. The more and better RAM you have, the faster your computer can work, especially when running multiple programs or games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Latency</strong> is the time it takes for the RAM to respond to a request from the computer’s processor. This is usually measured in CAS (Column Address Strobe) latency. The lower the CAS number, the faster the RAM can start processing data. For example, RAM with a CAS latency of 14 will generally perform faster than one with a CAS latency of 16. Lower latency is better because it means quicker response times, which is especially important in gaming or tasks that require a lot of processing power.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
    
            <!-- Image Column -->

                <div class="portfolio-text">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Speed</strong> is how fast the RAM can transfer data, measured in megahertz (MHz). The higher the MHz, the faster the data moves between the RAM and the processor. However, it’s crucial to ensure that the RAM speed matches what your processor and motherboard can handle. If you buy RAM that’s too fast for your system, it won’t run at its full potential. For most users, RAM speeds between 3000 MHz and 3600 MHz are common and provide excellent performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Modern RAM has come a long way compared to older versions. One of the most noticeable changes is the addition of <strong>heat sinks</strong>. A heat sink is a metal component attached to the RAM that helps dissipate heat, keeping the RAM cool even when it’s working hard. This prevents overheating, which can cause your computer to slow down or even crash. Older RAM didn’t have these heat sinks, making them more prone to overheating, especially during intensive tasks like gaming or video editing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another exciting feature of modern RAM is <strong>RGB syncable lighting</strong>. This means your RAM can light up in different colors, which you can customize to match the rest of your PC setup. While this doesn’t affect performance, it adds a cool aesthetic touch, making your PC look as good as it runs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When buying RAM, it’s essential to choose a reputable brand. Brands like <strong>G.Skill, Corsair, and Kingston</strong> are well-known for making high-quality RAM that lasts a long time. They offer a range of options, from budget-friendly models to high-performance RAM for gaming and professional use. These brands also provide warranties, so if something goes wrong with your RAM, you can get it replaced or fixed without much hassle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Final Tips for Buying RAM</strong>:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1. Always make sure the RAM you choose is compatible with your processor and motherboard in terms of speed and capacity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Lower latency numbers mean faster performance, so try to pick RAM with the lowest CAS latency rating you can find within your budget.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. To avoid counterfeit products, always buy RAM from trusted sellers who offer authentic products with a warranty.

            <p>
              Storage is  a Key Component of Your Custom PC.When building a custom PC, storage is one of the most important components to consider. It’s where you’ll store your operating system (OS) like Windows, Linux, Ubuntu, or macOS, as well as all your personal data. There are three main types of storage you can choose from:
            </p>
            <p>NVMe M.2 SSD:</p>
            <p>
  This is the fastest and most advanced type of storage available today. NVMe M.2 SSDs, including the latest Zen 3, Zen 4, and Zen 5 versions, offer incredible read/write speeds. For example, a Zen 5 SSD can reach up to 10,000 MB/s, making your applications open almost instantly and allowing you to work without any lag. NVMe SSDs are also very secure, making them the best choice for storing your data.
            </p>
            <p>SATA SSD:</p>
          </div>
        </div>
  
        <!-- Additional Text Column -->
        <div class="col-lg-12">
          <div class="portfolio-text">
            <p>
              SATA SSDs are a good option too, though they’re slower than NVMe SSDs. They typically offer speeds between 500 to 1,000 MB/s. While not as fast, they are more affordable, making them a solid choice for storing your data if you're on a budget.
            </p>
            <p>Hard Disk Drive (HDD):</p>
            <p>
              HDDs are the slowest and least secure option, with speeds between 300 to 500 MB/s. They are also prone to data loss, so they’re not recommended for storing important information. However, if cost is a concern, you can use a small NVMe SSD (128GB or 256GB) for your OS and a larger SATA SSD for your data and applications. This way, you get faster performance without breaking the bank.
            </p>
            <p>Pro Tip: Always buy your storage from a reputable seller to ensure you get a good warranty.

                    <p>
                        A graphics card is one of the key components in a custom PC build. It is essential for rendering and displaying images on your monitor. Graphics cards come in various ranges and types, primarily categorized by the chipset manufacturers: NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel. These chipsets are used by brands like ASUS, MSI, and Gigabyte to create their own graphics card products.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are two main types of graphics cards: dedicated and integrated.</p>
                    <p>
                        Dedicated Graphics Cards: These are separate, standalone units that offer superior performance compared to integrated options. They are ideal for demanding tasks such as gaming, video editing, and 3D rendering. With a dedicated graphics card, you can achieve higher frame rates and better overall visual quality.

                    <p>
                        Integrated Graphics Cards: These are built into the CPU itself, and while they can handle basic tasks and provide satisfactory performance for everyday use, they generally don't match the power of dedicated graphics cards. However, some CPUs come with powerful integrated graphics, known as APUs (Accelerated Processing Units), which can handle more demanding tasks without the need for a separate graphics card.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For optimal performance, especially in gaming or professional applications, a dedicated graphics card is usually the best choice. While an APU can suffice for less demanding applications, a dedicated graphics card will enhance your overall system performance and provide a better experience.

                  <p>A CPU cooler keeps your processor from overheating. Most processors come with a basic stock cooler, but if you want to keep your system running smoothly and avoid overheating, you might need an aftermarket cooler. Here are your options:</p>
                  <p>Stock Cooler: This is the basic cooler that comes with your processor and is free.</p>
                  <p>Air Cooler: These are available in the market and are good for most uses.</p>
                  <p>AIO Liquid Cooler: This type of cooler uses liquid to keep your CPU cool and is great for more demanding tasks.</p>
                  <p>Custom Liquid Cooler: This is the most advanced option, ideal for high-performance needs and adding a stylish touch to your PC.</p>
                  <p>Choosing a CPU cooler depends on your budget and performance needs. Plus, a nice cooler can enhance the look of your custom PC!</p>

                  <h2 class="custom-heading">Power Supply</h2>
                  <p>The power supply is like the safety net for your custom PC. It provides power to all the components, so it’s crucial to choose a high-quality one. Power supplies come in different ratings: Bronze, Gold, and Platinum.</p>
                  <p>For example, if you choose a 550-watt power supply with an 80 Plus Bronze rating, it means you’ll get a steady 550 watts of power. This is important because your PC needs that full 550 watts to run smoothly. If you use a non-rated power supply, you might not get the full 550 watts, which can cause problems.</p>
                  <p>To keep your PC safe and running well, always buy a power supply from a trusted seller and make sure it has a good rating.</p>
